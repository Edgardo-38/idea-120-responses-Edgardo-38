write a 1-2 paragraph proposal explaining the concept for your non-linear narrative

I wil be creating a poem about the Earth talking about all the things that are happening to the Earth because of humans. I will talk about how the Earth feels ignored, alone, sad, and different aspects that have been impacted by humans. I will frame the poem so that the Earth is talking in a first person perspective and is writing this poem to get the attention of humans. So that they know the things that they are doing have been impacting the Earth in a detrimental way and that they should make some changes in order to help the Earth. The poem will act as a plea from the Earth so that it does not get destroyed after humans have taken advantage of all the resources that the Earth provides. The Earth will point out the forests that have been cut, the forests that have been burned, the enviornment that is full of smog, how neglected the Earth feels, forgotten the Earth feels, and the Earth feeling alone.
