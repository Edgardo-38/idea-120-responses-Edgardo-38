Explain in about 1 paragraph what content you'll include in your portfolio and how it will be organized.

The content that will be included in my portfolio is that it will include all my three projects from this class. 
I will make a brief introduction page that includes the projects and what enjoyed learnied by maling these projects.
Afterwards I will list all the projects that I created and give a brief summary of what they entail. 
So that when you click on the link it forwards to that respective project and you will be able to explore my work.
Another thing that I will be added is a picture showing the work above the brief summary. So it will consit of 
the name of the Project, an image of the respective project, a brief summary, and then the link to the project.
